Prerequisites
=============

Qt Creator 2.3.x, 2.4.x, or 2.5.x
Source code of your Qt Creator version
Linux, Mac OS X (>=10.5), or Windows (XP or higher)

Note: plugin may also work on other Unix-like systems, earlier versions of
Windows, and Mac OS X 10.4, however they were not tested.

Building on Linux or Mac OS X
=============================

1. Get the source code of Qt Creator 2.3.1, or 2.4.1, or 2.5.1 (master
won't work). We will assume you've unpacked/cloned it to ~/src/qt-creator

2. Create ~/src/build-qtc and run
  qmake ../qt-creator
in that directory

3. Build Qt Creator with "make" command OR install the same version from
binaries

4. Run in source tree of this project:

  qmake QTC_SOURCE=~/src/qt-creator QTC_BUILD=~/src/build-qtc
  make

If you have Qt Creator sources in different localiton, execute make with
QTC_SOURCE variable set:

  qmake QTC_SOURCE=path/to/source/tree

Execution of qmake and make will "install" plugin inside source tree of Qt
Creator like it's done for other plugins during Qt Creator build. You may
need to copy resulting library into your Qt Creator installation directory.


Installation (Linux)
====================
When running qmake, set QTC_INSTALL_ROOT variable to installation prefix of
Qt Creator. Than you will be able to run "make install" to install plugin into
your production copy of Qt Creator.
