Prerequisites
=============

Qt Creator 2.2 or higher
Source code of your Qt Creator

Note: plugin was tested only on Linux and Mac OS X, but should also work on
Windows and Unix-like systems.

Compilation
===========

Clone this project into the same directory where Qt Creator sources are
located, than execute

  qmake
  make

If you have Qt Creator sources in different localiton, execute make with
QTC_SOURCE variable set:

  qmake QTC_SOURCE=path/to/source/tree

Execution of qmake and make will "install" plugin inside source tree of Qt
Creator like it's done for other plugins during Qt Creator build. You may
need to copy resulting library into your Qt Creator installation directory.

"make install" target against installed Qt Creator binary is not supported yet.
