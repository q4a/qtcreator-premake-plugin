PremakeProjectManager 0.1
=========================

First public release.

Features:
* premake4.lua files are opened as native project files. Visualization of
  project file tree is available, and you may select and edit files, just like
  with QMake or CMake projects.
* Plugin brings more thorough support of Lua in text editor: syntax highlighting
  on all platforms, indentation, and (very basic) autocompletion (e.g. pairs of
  parentheses)
* Plugin can build simple projects out of the box - just open premake4.lua and
  click "Build All" or "Build project". I've tested it on Premake project.
